## 3rd Party Libraries
    - React-Redux
    - Redux-Persist
    - React-Native-Linear-Gradient
    - React-Native-Vector-Icons
    - FastImage

## Why 3rd Party Libraries?
    - React-Redux: "for state management."
    - Redux-Persist: "to cache state data."
    - React-Native-Linear-Gradient: "for bottom shadow."
    - React-Native-Vector-Icons: "for Icons."
    - FastImage: "it has the ability to cache Image by the source link rendered."

    "I have limited devices to create the project, I don't own a Macintosh device and I only borrowed someone's Mac and I only have little time to compile the project to iOS, so that's why I use FastImage library rather than making my own ImageCaching, but if only I have the resources I can do the ImageCaching method."
